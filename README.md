# Which App is Activating on a Mac?

Recently the app I am typing into on my Mac randomly loses focus. This may help find out why.

The code is copied from [Mike Edmunds](https://github.com/medmunds) answer to the superuser question [How do I tell which app stole my focus in OS X?](https://superuser.com/a/874314/166855).
